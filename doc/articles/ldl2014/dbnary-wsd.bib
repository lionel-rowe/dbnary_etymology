abstract = {With the rise of the Web 2.0, collaboratively constructed language
resources are rivalling expert-built lexicons. The collaborative
construction process of these resources is driven by what is called the
\{\^{a}\}€\{\oe\}Wisdom of Crowds\{\^{a}\}€ phenomenon, which offers very promising research
opportunities in the context of electronic lexicography. The vast number
and broad diversity of authors yield, for instance, quickly growing and
constantly updated resources. While expert-built lexicons have been
extensively studied in the past, there is yet a gap in researching
collaboratively constructed lexicons. We therefore provide a comprehensive
description of Wiktionary \{\^{a}\}€`` a freely available, collaborative online
lexicon. We study the variety of encoded lexical, semantic, and
cross-lingual knowledge of three different language editions of Wiktionary
and compare the coverage of terms, lexemes, word senses, domains, and
registers to multiple expert-built lexicons. We conclude our work by
discussing several findings and pointing out Wiktionary\{\^{a}\}€\{$\backslash$texttrademark\}s future
directions and impact on lexicography.},
