abstract = {With the rise of the Web 2.0, collaboratively constructed language
resources are rivalling expert-built lexicons. The collaborative
construction process of these resources is driven by what is called the
\{\^{a}\}€\{\oe\}Wisdom of Crowds\{\^{a}\}€ phenomenon, which offers very promising research
opportunities in the context of electronic lexicography. The vast number
and broad diversity of authors yield, for instance, quickly growing and
constantly updated resources. While expert-built lexicons have been
extensively studied in the past, there is yet a gap in researching
collaboratively constructed lexicons. We therefore provide a comprehensive
description of Wiktionary \{\^{a}\}€`` a freely available, collaborative online
lexicon. We study the variety of encoded lexical, semantic, and
cross-lingual knowledge of three different language editions of Wiktionary
and compare the coverage of terms, lexemes, word senses, domains, and
registers to multiple expert-built lexicons. We conclude our work by
discussing several findings and pointing out Wiktionary\{\^{a}\}€\{$\backslash$texttrademark\}s future
directions and impact on lexicography.},

@article{TC320,
abstract = {Multilingual lexical-semantic resources play an important role in translation applications. However, multilingual resources with sufficient quality and coverage are rare as the effort of manually constructing such a resource is substantial. In recent years, the emergence of Web 2.0 has opened new possibilities for constructing large-scale lexical-semantic resources. We identified Wiktionary and OmegaWiki as two important multilingual initiatives where a community of users (“crowd”) collaboratively edits and refines the lexical information. They seem especially appropriate in the multilingual domain as users from all languages and cultures can easily contribute. However, despite their advantages such as open access and coverage of multiple languages, these resources have hardly been systematically investigated and utilized until now. Therefore, the goals of our contribution are threefold: (1) We analyze how these resources emerged and characterize their content and structure; (2) We propose an alignment at the word sense level to exploit the complementary information contained in both esources for increased coverage; (3) We describe a mapping of the resources to a standardized, unified model (UBY-LMF) thus creating a large freely available multilingual resource designed for easy integration into applications such as machine translation or computer-aided translation environments.},

controlled (GermaNet), semi-controlled (OpenThesaurus), or collaborative,
i.e. community-based, manner (Wiktionary). For the first time, the
comparison of the corresponding resources is performed at the word sense
level. For this purpose, the word senses of terms are automatically
disambiguated in Wiktionary and the content of all resources is converted
to a uniform representation. We show that the resources' topology is well
comparable as they share the small world property and contain a comparable
number of entries, although differences in their connectivity exist. Our
study of content related properties reveals that the German Wiktionary has
a different distribution of word senses and contains more polysemous
entries than both other resources. We identify that each resource contains
the highest number of a particular type of semantic relation. We finally
increase the number of relations in Wiktionary by considering symmetric and
inverse relations that have been found to be usually absent in this
resource.},
