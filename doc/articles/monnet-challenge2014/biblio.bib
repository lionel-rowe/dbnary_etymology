This document defines a textual syntax for {RDF} called Turtle that allows {RDF} graphs to be completely written in a compact and natural text form, with abbreviations for common usage patterns and datatypes. Turtle provides levels of compatibility with the existing {N-Triples} and Notation 3 formats as well as the triple pattern syntax of the {SPARQL} {W3C} Proposed Recommendation.

This document specifies a language that is in common usage under the name "Turtle". It is intended to be compatible with, and a subset of, Notation 3.},

	Abstract = {With the rise of the Web 2.0, collaboratively constructed language
resources are rivalling expert-built lexicons. The collaborative
construction process of these resources is driven by what is called the
{\^a}€{\oe}Wisdom of Crowds{\^a}€ phenomenon, which offers very promising research
opportunities in the context of electronic lexicography. The vast number
and broad diversity of authors yield, for instance, quickly growing and
constantly updated resources. While expert-built lexicons have been
extensively studied in the past, there is yet a gap in researching
collaboratively constructed lexicons. We therefore provide a comprehensive
description of Wiktionary {\^a}€`` a freely available, collaborative online
lexicon. We study the variety of encoded lexical, semantic, and
cross-lingual knowledge of three different language editions of Wiktionary
and compare the coverage of terms, lexemes, word senses, domains, and
registers to multiple expert-built lexicons. We conclude our work by
discussing several findings and pointing out Wiktionary{\^a}€{\texttrademark}s future
directions and impact on lexicography.},

	Abstract = {The lack of large-scale, freely available and durable lexical resources, and the consequences for NLP, is widely acknowledged but the attempts to cope with usual bottlenecks preventing their development often result in dead-ends. This article introduces a language-independent, semi-automatic and endogenous method for enriching lexical resources, based on collaborative editing and random walks through existing lexical relationships, and shows how this approach enables us to overcome recurrent impediments. It compares the impact of using different data sources and similarity measures on the task of improving synonymy networks. Finally, it defines an architecture for applying the presented method to Wiktionary and explains how it has been implemented.},

abstract = {Multilingual lexical-semantic resources play an important role in translation applications. However, multilingual resources with sufficient quality and coverage are rare as the effort of manually constructing such a resource is substantial. In recent years, the emergence of Web 2.0 has opened new possibilities for constructing large-scale lexical-semantic resources. We identified Wiktionary and OmegaWiki as two important multilingual initiatives where a community of users (“crowd”) collaboratively edits and refines the lexical information. They seem especially appropriate in the multilingual domain as users from all languages and cultures can easily contribute. However, despite their advantages such as open access and coverage of multiple languages, these resources have hardly been systematically investigated and utilized until now. Therefore, the goals of our contribution are threefold: (1) We analyze how these resources emerged and characterize their content and structure; (2) We propose an alignment at the word sense level to exploit the complementary information contained in both esources for increased coverage; (3) We describe a mapping of the resources to a standardized, unified model (UBY-LMF) thus creating a large freely available multilingual resource designed for easy integration into applications such as machine translation or computer-aided translation environments.},

lexical semantic resources for the German language constructed either in a
controlled (GermaNet), semi-controlled (OpenThesaurus), or collaborative,
i.e. community-based, manner (Wiktionary). For the first time, the
comparison of the corresponding resources is performed at the word sense
level. For this purpose, the word senses of terms are automatically
disambiguated in Wiktionary and the content of all resources is converted
to a uniform representation. We show that the resources' topology is well
comparable as they share the small world property and contain a comparable
number of entries, although differences in their connectivity exist. Our
study of content related properties reveals that the German Wiktionary has
a different distribution of word senses and contains more polysemous
entries than both other resources. We identify that each resource contains
the highest number of a particular type of semantic relation. We finally
increase the number of relations in Wiktionary by considering symmetric and
inverse relations that have been found to be usually absent in this
resource.},

We investigate a number of different metrics proposed by different communities, including edit-distance metrics, fast heuristic string comparators , token-based distance metrics, and hybrid methods. Overall, the best-performing method is a hybrid scheme combining a TFIDF weighting scheme, which is widely used in information retrieval, with the Jaro-Winkler string-distance scheme, which was developed in the probabilistic record linkage community.},
