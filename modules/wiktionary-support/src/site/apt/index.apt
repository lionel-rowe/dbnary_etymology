Wiktionary Support

  Wiktionary wupport allows you to extract a lexical network from a wiktionary dump file.

* Provided command lines

  The wiktionary support module provides several command lines.

  * <<<GetRawEntry>>> dumps the wiki syntax of the requeste entry in the standard output.
    This is useful to view the original entry used to extract the lexical data, especially when the dump file weights more than 2 GB. 

  * <<<GetExtractedSemnet>>> extract the lexical network from one or several entries given as command line arguments.
